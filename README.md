# PostFire-Tree-Mortality
R code for post-fire tree mortality analyses

# Disclaimer
This code was used in the analysis of post-fire tree mortality in the manuscript "The waning predictive ability of crown and bole injury for post-fire tree mortality in eight western USA conifers" currently in minor revisions for the journal Ecological Applications. I am sure there is a more efficient way to code these analyses and in the future I hope to update it with better code. For now, this is exactly what was used in the paper. Please forgive my messy coding style!

The data are from the Fire and Tree Mortality database (FTM, Cansler et al. 2020), available at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2020-0001.
