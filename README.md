# PostFire-Tree-Mortality
R code for post-fire tree mortality analyses

# Disclaimer
This code was used in the analysis of post-fire tree mortality in the manuscript "Predictive accuracy of post-fire conifer death declines over time in models based on crown and bole injury " currently accepted in the journal Ecological Applications. I am sure there is a more efficient way to code these analyses and in the future I hope to update it with better code. For now, this is exactly what was used in the paper. I have added comments throughout the code to help anyone make sense of what I did but feel free to send a message if you have any qustions.

The code is free to use for anyone. Suggestions for improvements are always welcome. Contact tshearman@talltimbers.org for any questions/comments.

The data are from the Fire and Tree Mortality database (FTM, Cansler et al. 2020), available at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2020-0001.
